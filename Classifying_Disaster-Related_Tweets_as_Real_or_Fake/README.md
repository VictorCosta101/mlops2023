## Classifying Disaster-Related Tweets as Real or Fake

I contributed to a project focused on classifying disaster-related tweets using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques. Throughout this project, I developed and evaluated various text classification models, ranging from basic models to advanced architectures like bidirectional LSTMs and Transformers. Leveraging TensorFlow and Keras libraries, I built and trained these models, exploring techniques such as vectorization, word embedding, regularization, and Dropout layers to enhance model accuracy and efficiency.

Additionally, I conducted a detailed analysis of the results, aiming to derive valuable insights for future enhancements. This experience enriched my knowledge in natural language processing and equipped me with robust skills in constructing and assessing text classification models.
