# Project 01 - A Movie Recommendation System in Python

## Introduction

This project is founded on the principles elucidated in the "Build a Movie Recommendation System in Python," a Portfolio Project available on Dataquest.This project embodies the culmination of our exploration into recommender systems, encapsulating the synthesis of learned knowledge and practical insights. It underscores the significance of leveraging machine learning and data engineering to create tailored user experiences and further enrich the domain of data science.
### Methodology

The core of our recommendation system relies on content-based filtering, a method that assesses movie similarity by employing TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity. The project code seamlessly downloads a dataset, processes it, and utilizes the applied techniques to identify and deliver a list of movie recommendations to the user.

### Objectives

- Implement a content-based movie recommendation system.
- Download and preprocess a suitable dataset for analysis.
- Utilize TF-IDF and cosine similarity to measure movie similarity.
- Deliver personalized movie recommendations based on user input.
