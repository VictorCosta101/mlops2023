# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Project

## Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Predictive modeling of cardiovascular diseases is a crucial research area in the domain of public health and clinical medicine. This project aims to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk of cardiovascular diseases based on various health parameters.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of a comprehensive collection of medical records, including demographic information, clinical measurements, and patient outcomes. It is sourced from a reputable medical institution and contains both structured and unstructured data.

## Objectives
- To build a predictive model that accurately identifies individuals at risk of cardiovascular diseases.
- To explore the relationships between various health parameters and the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases.


## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, normalization, and handling missing data.
2. **Feature Selection:** Identifying relevant features that contribute to the prediction task.
3. **Model Selection:** Utilizing machine learning algorithms 
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance in terms of accuracy and precision
