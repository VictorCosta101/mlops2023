# Project 02 - An Airflow Data Pipeline to Download Podcasts

## Introduction

This project takes its inspiration from the "Build an Airflow Data Pipeline to Download Podcasts" project offered by Dataquest, with the objective of elevating its functionality and capabilities through the integration of MLOps principles. The endeavor exemplifies the intersection of data engineering, automation, and machine learning operations.

### Project Overview

The central focus of this project revolves around the creation and orchestration of an Airflow Data Pipeline, designed to facilitate the automated retrieval of recent Marketplace podcast episodes. By enhancing the original project with MLOps concepts, we reinforce the significance of seamlessly managing data workflows for podcast acquisition, thereby exemplifying the modern approach to data engineering.

### Methodology

The core of this project hinges on defining an Airflow Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that encapsulates a series of tasks responsible for automating various aspects of podcast acquisition. The pipeline encompasses the following essential tasks:

1. Database creation for information storage.
2. Podcast episode fetching to acquire the latest content.
3. Data loading for persistent storage.
4. Audio file downloading to enable listening.

### Objectives

- Extend the capabilities of the Airflow Data Pipeline.
- Automate the process of downloading recent Marketplace podcast episodes.
- Incorporate MLOps concepts for efficient data workflow management.
- Store and manage podcast episode data in a SQLite database.
- Enable users to access and enjoy the podcast episodes effortlessly.
